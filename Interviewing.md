# Software Engineer - Interview formats
- *Coding* - Data structures, Algorithms, problem solving.
  - straight up leetcode problem (mostly a medium or an easy)
  - leetcode problem disguised as a real world scenario
- *System Design* - Architect, high level design a real world distributed application. Example - Design Yelp, Uber, Google search, etc.
  - (the above two interviews are most popular with FAANGs and wanna be FAANGs)
- *Resume walkthrough* - Questions based on past projects from your resume. Example, they might ask how you approached and solved the most challenging project in your career. For this, pick a project or two that can show case your technical depth, your Lead engineer qualities and distributed systems knowledge. Prepared to talk about it concisely, present a good story. For this it would be good to research about the Team/Role you are interviewing for and pick a project that would be relevant for them. Be prepared to walk through any trade offs that you made, explain your decision making process.
  - The above can also be a part of Coding and System design interviews
- *Manager interview* - This could be about team fit, your motivation to join the company, some questions about your past (such as why have you changed jobs frequently, etc.).
- *Behavioral interview* - Tests your leadership abilities, collobration skills, people management abilities, soft skills, confict resolution abilities etc. Be prepared to answer questions like, Tell me about a time when you missed a deadline, Tell us about a time when you had to disagree with your manager, etc. Be concise and go prepared with stories that had a (1) challenge/problem (2) How you approached it, dealt with it (3) Outcome and lessons learnt. Of course the ending should be a positive one for you and the Org.


# General thoughts
- Software engineer interviews are much tougher than the job itself. Most hiring managers and recruiters boast about their company, hype up the role and conduct bombastic interviews. But in my experience, the reality is only 20% of what was said in the interview.
- Interviewers can be biased, sometimes wrong or mislead you, hijack the conversation and through your off track.
