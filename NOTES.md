# My journey to be a Software Engineer

I have a Masters degree in Computer science from an accredited university, have about 17 years of industry experience (major US corporations). I got laid off (for the first time) by the end of 2024, it's been close to a couple of months of job search - I'm struggling to land interviews, and struggling a lot harder to clear the interviews once I land them. 

Landing interviews are somewhat beyond my control at this time, they are particulary challenging in my case, as I'm searching for jobs in the US while not being a US citizen. However, clearing tech interviews can be done. It is a known format. Though the preparation is arduous, a lot of it is about CS theory (though there are communication and leadership aspects), which can be mastered. 

Now, I could very complain about the tech industry and the interviewing process in particular - it is inherently extremely biased at the outset and the process itself is a big mess. I can't do much about it other than whining, so I decided to spend my time and effort in productive things such as learning (re-learning) Software Engineering and I want to document my learnings along the way.

I feel writing what one learnt helps to sustain the information in the brain.
Also, my notes could resonate with others and it could help them.
